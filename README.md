Developed a cloud-based application that automates the extraction and analysis of receipt data using AI. Leveraged Google Cloud Vision API for OCR and Gemini Pro LLM for interpreting scanned content with 95% accuracy. Deployed the solution using Docker and Google Cloud Run to enable scalable, serverless execution. Integrated Google Cloud Storage to manage and retrieve receipt files efficiently. This project helps users simplify expense tracking by eliminating manual data entry and organizing receipts automatically.
